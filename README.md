# Medical Image Annotation Job👩🏻‍⚕️🩺
In this project, I built a labeled dataset that distinguishes between healthy and pneumonia x-ray images; this can be used by ML engineers later on down the line to build a classification product under Udacity AI for Business Nanodegree program. I created a data labeling job using [Appen's platform](https://client.appen.com/sessions/new).
